This repository is supportive to the following manuscript:
 Al-Ghawanmeh, F., Jensenius, A., and Sma√Øli, K. Arab Music Improvisation Corpus for Research (AMICOR): Development and Machine Translation Experiments. Journal manuscript submitted for review in August 2023.


 We have made the following resources accessible to the research community online: a parallel music dataset comprising 7K sentences distributed across 8 maqam-based sub-datasets, accompanied by a set of Matlab functions for dataset pre-processing. Additionally, initial versions of two Java applications has been shared: 1) the Mawaweel application, integrating the best-performing machine translation model to offer real-time instrumental audio responses to vocal audio prompts; 2) The Corpus Maker application, developed to streamline the dataset construction. Furthermore, we have included a collection of symbolic case studies interpreting the results, alongside a selection of illustrative audio and video examples.

 We note that we provide two versions of the dataset: a fully processed version in text format, and a MATLAB version with only very minor processing. While the former was used in our MT experimentation, the latter preserves durations without quantization and allows for a wider range of scale degrees spanning over two octaves (i.e., full vocal range and most of the instrumental range). This provides the research community with a higher-resolution dataset for further explorations.

While the article's manuscript uses an illustrative data representation, her in GitHub, letters (a to g) correspond to the 1st through 7th scale degrees, while numbers (1-8) signify quantized durations from shortest to longest.
